This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
1. Read the yelp data.csv provided to you in the course shell.
```{r}
getwd()
yelp_reduced <- read.csv(file="yelp_dataset.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
yelp_reduced
```
2. Have a look at the dataset by using the head command.
```{r}
head(yelp_reduced)
```
3. Prepare data for modeling.
Splitting the dataset into training and test sets:
```{r}
train_index <- sample(1:nrow(yelp_reduced), 0.7 * nrow(yelp_reduced))
train.set <- yelp_reduced[train_index,]
test.set <- yelp_reduced[-train_index,]
```

Removing the class column from our training and test datasets:
```{r}
train.set_new <- train.set[-2]
test.set_new <- test.set[-2]

```


4. Create a logistic regression model.
```{r}
glm_model <- glm(class~.,train.set, family = "binomial")
summary(glm_model)


```
5. Assume a new coffee shop has just opened in Toronto and wants to know the probability
of being above average restaurant (class=1). The coffee shop is expecting to receive 200
reviews from its customers. Predict the probability of the coffee shop to be ranked as
above average.

```{r}
predict(glm_model, newdata=data.frame(city="Toronto", review_count=200,categories="Coffee or Sandwiches"), type="response")
```
6. Evaluate the performance of the model. Calculate the accuracy.

```{r}
predicted <- predict(glm_model, test.set, type="response")
predicted_class <- ifelse(predicted>=0.5, 1, 0)
ConfusionMatrix_V1 <- table(actual = test.set$class,predicted = predicted_class)
ConfusionMatrix

```
```{r}
sum(diag(ConfusionMatrix_V1))/nrow(test.set)

```



`
```{r}

```
